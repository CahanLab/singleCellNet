# singleCellNet

### Introduction
SingleCellNet enables the classifcation of single cell RNA-Seq data across species and platforms. See [BioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/12/31/508085) for details. 

Here, we illustrate ... 

- how to build and assess single cell classifiers 

- how to build and assess cross-species single cell classifiers

- how to use these classifiers to quantify 'cell identity' from query scRNA-Seq data

If you want to use the bulk RNA-Seq version of CellNet, go to [bulk CellNet](https://github.com/pcahan1/CellNet).
